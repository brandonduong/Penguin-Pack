# The Rose

## Introduction ##
This is a mod for one of my favourite games, 
[**Slay the Spire**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/), which is entirely based off my 
cute penguin plushies.<br>
Like many other mods, this mod needs [ModTheSpire](https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/releases), 
[BaseMod](https://github.com/daviscook477/BaseMod/releases),
and [StSLib](https://github.com/kiooeht/StSLib) to work.

## Content and Gameplay ##
This mod contains one entirely new character, named The Rose, of which is flavoured around one of my many cute penguin plushies. <br>
She is strong yet lazy, and always ready to eat.

This mod also contains both global and character-specific relics, potions, monsters, and events, of which again, are
tastefully flavoured around penguins, and the arctic.
